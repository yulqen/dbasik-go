## dbasik-go

This is an API of `datamaps` in the cloud. For when the command line is alien or you want to point your populated spreadsheets at someone else's computer in the sky.

## Repositories

This is a mirror of the working repositories at `https://git.yulqen.org/go/dbasik-go/`. Only releases will be pushed to Github. Consider the centralisation effect of our reliance on Github and other proprietary platforms.
